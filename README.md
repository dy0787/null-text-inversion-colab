# Null-Txt Inversion Colab Notebook

This repo stores a working version of Google's [null-text inversion](https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt) paper.

The example here only showcases the local edition (`Replacement`) feature. I plan to add examples of `Refinement` and `Re-weight` soon:tm:.

All credits go to the authors of the paper and Google.

Feel free to copy my code and ask for questions! :blush:
